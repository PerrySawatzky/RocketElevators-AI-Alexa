## Setup
Set up with a project like this is a little different since the project is created within an online code editor. But here you all are anyways!

- Step 1: Create your very own Amazon developer account.
- Step 2: Create a new Alexa skill with a name of your choosing, then head to the 'Build' tab.
- Step 4: Set the Skill Invocation name to 'rocket elevators'.
- Step 4: Navigate from the left side of the screen and click on Interaction Model > JSON Editor and paste in our en-CA.json file located from this repo in interactionModels > custom > en-CA.json.
- Step 5: Once you've pasted the json you can Save Model and Build Model.
- Step 6: Beside the build tab near the top of the screen is the Code tab, head there for the next step of this setup. 
- Step 7: Next is to copy in the lambda folder from the repo into your editor.
- Step 8: Save and Deploy.
- Step 9: If all was successful you can now test the Alexa capabilities on the next tab after Code. Test!
- Step 10: Initiate the test with the invocation name 'rocket elevators', then you can ask "whats going on at rocket elevators" or "what's the status of elevator 33?" We have 198 elevators currently so any number under 199 will work.
